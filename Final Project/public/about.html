          <p>UHack is a club created by Kyle Barr and Junninho Thomas that focuses on eSports and Tech events. The purpose of the club is to create and organize eSports and Technology events such as tournaments,
            hackathons, get-togethers, and more. Through these events many clubs and people come together to have a great time and interact with each other.
          </p><br>
          <p>The idea was hashed after Kyle and Junninho hosted a small 18-player Super Smash Bros. for Wii U event in November of 2016. The tournament was originally made only for the floor of their hall, but they
            decided to open the tournament to the public. There were 18 players registered for the event, however, right before the torunament started, many people came flooding in asking if they could play.
            If they had let those people play, the tournament would have been over 30 people.
          </p><br>
          <p>They are currently oganizing a campus-wide 64-Player Super Smash Bros. Tournament. This tournament will involve many people and will be livestreamed to the internet to an expected audience of at
            least 200 people. They hope that this event can help pave the way for the club in the future and allow many people on campus to be more involved in the thing this generation is defined for: technology.
          </p>
